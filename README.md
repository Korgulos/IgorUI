# Ui for my son

### Simple application for training my son to recognise colors.

![UI pic](/Utils/Pictures/UI%20sample.png)

This UI is in Serbian language, when started from ***main.py*** automatically opes in random intervals between 1 and 5 min.

If you want to convert this app to ***.exe***, I recommend [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/) with command:

`nuitka --standalone --disable-console --enable-plugin=pyside6 main.py`
